#You can use apt-get or aptitude to install the .deb packages and must be superuser.

#1. Debian has openvswitch-switch and openvswitch-common .deb packages that includes the core userspace components of the switch.

#2. For kernel datapath, openvswitch-datapath-dkms can be installed to automatically build and install Open vSwitch kernel module for your running kernel. This package is only available when the .deb packages are built from the Open vSwitch repository; it is not downstream in Debian or Ubuntu releases.

#3. For fast userspace switching, Open vSwitch with DPDK support is bundled in the package openvswitch-switch-dpdk. This package is only available in the Ubuntu distribution; it is not upstream in the Open vSwitch repository or downstream in Debian.

apt update
apt install -y openvswitch-switch openvswitch-common openvswitch-datapath-dkms openvswitch-switch-dpdk.
